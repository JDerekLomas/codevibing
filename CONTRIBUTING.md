# Contributing to CodeVibing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CodeVibing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Sharing AI-generated components

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, add tests where appropriate.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code is properly formatted.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/JDerekLomas/codevibing/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/JDerekLomas/codevibing/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow the existing code style
* Use Prettier for formatting
